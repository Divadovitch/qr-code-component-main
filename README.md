## My process

Use variable for colors, rem for font size, respect the minimum size of the card from the model. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use `box-sizing: border-box;` to control the size without having to calculate the marging and padding, use `svh` for the height and flexbox to center div. Add `width: 100%` to an img to fit all the horizontal space of the parent.
